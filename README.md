 *<h1 align=center >Hi there!!ðŸ‘‹</h1>*

-   I am  Nick Moutafis and  I have recently started studying full-stack development. I find it to be a very creative and interesting field and I want to explore
    the possibillities  that development has to offer.      
     
-   ðŸ”­  I graduated last summer from Coding Factory, a cutting- edge education program in Full - Stack application development 
    (provided by Athens University of Economics and Business).
    I gained hands-on experience in multiple programming languages and in my repositories you will find some projects on them.
    
- Currently I work as Software Engineer
